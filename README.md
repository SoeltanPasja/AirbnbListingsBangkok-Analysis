## **Business Understanding**

### **Background**

As Bangkok's tourism industry continues to thrive, Airbnb has emerged as a leading platform for travelers seeking unique and affordable accommodations. However, with the increasing number of listings, hosts face challenges in setting competitive prices, understanding market dynamics, and optimizing their listings to maximize occupancy. This analysis leverages data-driven insights to help Airbnb hosts in Bangkok navigate the complexities of the market. By analyzing key factors such as geospatial competition, pricing trends, occupancy rates, and the influence of language and keywords used in listing description, this study provides actionable strategies for hosts to enhance their listings, attract more guests, and increase their revenue.

### **Problems to Address**

1. **Geospatial Competition and Density:** How do the density and geographic distribution of listings affect competition among Airbnb hosts across different neighbourhoods in Bangkok?
2. **Seasonal Trends and Pricing:** What are the seasonal trends in listing availability and pricing, and how can Airbnb partners adjust their strategies to maximize occupancy throughout the year?
3. **Optimal Minimum Nights Policy:** What is the impact of minimum night stay policies on booking frequency and revenue, and how can Airbnb partners optimize this setting?
4. **Language and Keyword Impact:** How do the language, sentiment, and keywords used in listing descriptions influence booking rates, review counts, and pricing?
